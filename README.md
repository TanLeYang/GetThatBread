GetThatBread is a platform to help you prepare for technical interviews by practicing with mock interviews.

It has everything you need to simulate a full interview experience:

- a collaborative code editor to practice writing code
- video calling to practice your communication skills
- execute your code to verify the correctness of your solution

Check out the video demo [here](https://youtu.be/2Yz3tOgO2xQ)!
